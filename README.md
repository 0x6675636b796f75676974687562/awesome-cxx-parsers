# Awesome C++ Parsers
An overview of C and C++ parsers available for Kotlin/JVM and Kotlin/MP

## [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org)

### CLI (`clang`)

 * Kotlin/JVM ‚úî, Kotlin/MP ‚úî
 * Available since at least _Clang_ version 11.
 * [_Rust_ bindings](https://github.com/dtolnay/clang-ast)

#### Overview

Getting an AST tree is as easy as

```bash
clang++ -fsyntax-only -Xclang -ast-dump=json file.cc >file.json
```

The AST can also be dumped in binary form, to be later on consumed and parsed by
[`libclang`](#libclang-c-interface-to-clang) ([example](https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2015/baby_steps_libclang_ast/)):

```bash
# Will produce file.ast
clang++ -emit-ast file.cc
```

#### Example

Here's a [JSON output](Shape.json) for a [sample C++ class](Shape.cc).

Field access on [line 8](Shape.cc#L8) is correctly recognized as a
[`clang::MemberExpr`](Shape.json#L554)
([reference](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1MemberExpr.html)).

Notably, GCC-style mangled C++ symbol names are also stored in the JSON:

```json
{
   "id": "0x8001988b0",
   "kind": "ParmVarDecl",
   "loc": {
      "offset": 36,
      "line": 3,
      "col": 15,
      "tokLen": 11
   },
   "range": {
      "begin": {
         "offset": 32,
         "col": 11,
         "tokLen": 3
      },
      "end": {
         "offset": 36,
         "col": 15,
         "tokLen": 11
      }
   },
   "isUsed": true,
   "name": "shapeHeight",
   "mangledName": "_ZZN5ShapeC1EiE11shapeHeight",
   "type": {
      "qualType": "int"
   }
}
```

Here, `_ZZN5ShapeC1EiE11shapeHeight` is a mangled name which corresponds to
`Shape::Shape(int)::shapeHeight`:

```console
$ echo '_ZZN5ShapeC1EiE11shapeHeight' | c++filt
Shape::Shape(int)::shapeHeight
```

`ParmVarDecl` specifies a JSON-serialized instance of
[`clang::ParmVarDecl`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1ParmVarDecl.html)
class from the [C++ API](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/namespaceclang.html).

### [`clangd`](https://clangd.llvm.org/)

 * Kotlin/JVM ‚úî, Kotlin/MP ‚úî
 * Supports [LSP **3.17**](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/)
    plus [extensions](https://clangd.llvm.org/extensions)
 * Can provide [`clang::clangd::ParsedAST`](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/doxygen/classclang_1_1clangd_1_1ParsedAST.html),
    which, in turn, can be used to access [`clang::ASTContext`](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/classclang_1_1ASTContext.html)
 * [Features](https://clangd.llvm.org/features)

#### Overview

 * Sample response [JSON response](clangd-response.json) from `clangd`.
 * `clangd` tool window in _CLion_:

    ![](images/clion-clangd-tool-window.png) 

#### Used by

 * [_JetBrains CLion_](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)

### `libclang`: C Interface to _Clang_

 * Java bindings to _Clang_ version **15** are available via
   [_JavaCPP Presets_](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/tree/master/llvm) (Kotlin/JVM ‚úî, Kotlin/MP ‚ùå).
 * [API reference](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html)

#### Overview

 * `libclang` has its limitations
    and [doesn't expose](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/Tooling.html#libclang) the
    entire AST.
    Read [this](https://www.foonathan.net/2017/04/cppast/) for further details.
 * `libclang` tokens are not preprocessed.

### `LibTooling`: C++ Interface to _Clang_

 * No Kotlin/JVM ‚ùå, no Kotlin/MP ‚ùå (unless wrappers are written manually)
 * C++ API

## [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)

### Overview

 * Kotlin/JVM ‚úî available via [Java](https://github.com/serenadeai/java-tree-sitter)
   or [Kotlin](https://github.com/oxisto/kotlintree) bindings
 * Kotlin/MP ‚úî possible by wrapping a native platform binary
 * Kotlin/JS ‚úî possible by wrapping `tree-sitter.js`
 * Has built-in support for its own [query language](https://neovim.io/doc/user/treesitter.html#treesitter-query)

Initially it was designed by GitHub for their [Atom IDE](https://github.com/atom/) which was sunset to be replaced by CodeHub/VS Code.
Designed to tokenize code with focus on tracking changes in a file.

 * Activity of the project:
 Project contains two parts: parser (specification) and binding (api).
 Specification are hosted under the main GitHub organization [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) and looks like it's being updated (checked java/cpp).

 But bindings look like a very alpha (checked _Java_ and _Kotlin_).

 According to the [`README.md`](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter#readme)
 and articles: looks like `tree-sitter` is targeted at Web:
 `Web Tree-sitter`/`WASM` is part of the main library:
 <https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/tree/master/lib/binding_web>.

 Additionally, it's used as a plugin in popular editors and actively supported:
 [_Neovim_](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter) and
 [_Emacs_](https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter)

#### Limitations

The parser of _tree-sitter_ doesn't always track context,
so, using the following C++ source code,

```c++
class Shape {
public:
   Shape(int shapeHeight) {
       height = shapeHeight;
   }

   int getHeight() {
       return height;
   }

private:
   int height;
};
```

&mdash;
it incorrectly recognizes field access as an
`identifier` (i.e. local variable) and not a `field_identifier`
(for the code to be parsed correctly,
one should change `height` &rarr; `this.height`).
The same problem affects even simpler-to-parse languages,
such as _Java_ and _Kotlin_.

For example,
both field access and local variable access are erroneously recognized as `simple_identifier`:

```kotlin
class Shape(private val height: Int) {
    fun getHeight(): Int {
        return height
    }
}
```

Another example is inability to differentiate between a function call and a
macro call in C and C++:

```c
static void f1() {
    // ...
}

static void f2() {
    // ...
}

#define f1() f2()

void g() {
    // Calls `f2()`, not `f1()`.
    f1();
}
```

### PoC
Tried to create a POC using **tree-sitter**. Run on WSL\Linux.

 * [Custom grammar](tree-sitter-boolean/README.md)

### Implementations

 * [C++ Grammar](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-cpp) (45 üç¥, 156 ‚≠ê)
   * Portable: can be built with at least `g++` **10** and `clang++` **13**
     (and, probably, earlier versions). 
 * [Kotlin bindings](https://github.com/oxisto/kotlintree) (2 üç¥, 28 ‚≠ê)
   * Uses JNA. 
   * The native library has to be manually built first (requires `clang++`).
   * The project wraps `libtree-sitter.{so,dylib}` (**0.20.1**) and
     `libtree-sitter-cpp.{so,dylib}` (**0.19.0**) via JNA.
   * _Linux_ and _Mac OS X_ only.
 * [Java bindings](https://github.com/serenadeai/java-tree-sitter) (19 üç¥, 61 ‚≠ê)
   * Uses JNI.
   * The native library has to be manually built first.
   * Be sure to clone with `--recurse-submodules`.
   * Can't be built using JDK 17 due to outdated _Gradle_.
 * [Playground](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/playground) (C, C++ and other languages)
 * [Playground](https://fwcd.dev/tree-sitter-kotlin/) (Kotlin grammar, unofficial)
